## Overview
### Description
App that integrates with user's calendar to suggest tasks for working towards a goal that the user can select from a few options. Potential options include doing any habit(reading, exercising, going outside). App suggests times to do the activity and user can add those events to their calendar. Once the task is added to their calendar, the app keeps track of the user's phone use during the designated time, making sure that the user stays on the app in order to help user focus on scheduled task. If the exits the app, something *spooky* will happen. 
Once the user completes the activity for a designated period of time, the user is able to take a picture of something to show progress(a plant, the user, pretty much anything that slowly changes over time). This picture gets added to the user's timeline and user is able to view their progress through a timelapse/gallery of their pictures. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle, productivity
- **Mobile:** Since a phone is often the cause of distractions, having the app on mobile prevents the phone from being a source of distration during the task. Also, a mobile platform allows the user to use the camera to great a timelapse of their progress
- **Story:** It's really hard to build a habit, especially a good one. This app encourages users to make goals for themselves and enforces good habit building by removing distractions. Progress is also hard to see, which is what the timeline is for. This app is something that I would find very useful. 
- **Market:** Everyone has goals and good habits they want to form, this app helps people reach their goal one day at a time. Anyone could find this app useful since it is very flexible in helping the user achieve whatever goal they want. 
- **Habit:** Users would ideally use this app everyday in order to build. consistent habit. Visible progress is addictive, which is the main function of the timeline. 
- **Scope:** In its most boiled down form, this app is just a calendar app, which should be feasible to implement. There are also many additional features that can and will be implemented including acitvity blocking for the phone, reminders for scheduled habeet events, sharing progress, a friends feature that allows people to grow habeets together.
